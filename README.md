# Learning about Version Control
### Author: Shivani Aggarwal

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I like that version control ensures that all the previous versions are backed up in a central system and allows for a systematic way to resolve conflicts and/or divide work.
However, I find remembering/keeping in mind all the good practices and ways to recover work very challenging. I don't fully understand workflows either so resolving version control in a large and complex repository can be a lot more difficult in practice.
